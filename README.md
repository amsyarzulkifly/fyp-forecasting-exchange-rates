# Forecasting Malaysia's Exchange Rates using ARIMA and DARIMA Models  

## üìå Project Overview  
This final year project forecasts Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) exchange rates using **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** and **Distributed ARIMA (DARIMA)** models. The study is based on daily exchange rate data from Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) spanning 2014 to 2022 and focuses on three major currencies: the **United States Dollar (USD)**, **Euro (EUR)**, and **British Pound Sterling (GBP)**.

## üîé Why ARIMA and DARIMA?  
Exchange rates are sequential time series data that often exhibit **trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation**.  

- **ARIMA** is one of the most established statistical models for time series forecasting. It effectively captures temporal dependencies, making it suitable for financial data like exchange rates.  
- **DARIMA (Distributed ARIMA)** extends ARIMA by partitioning large datasets into smaller subsets, fitting ARIMA models individually, and then combining the results. This approach improves forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency, especially for high-frequency financial data.  

These models provide a strong statistical foundation and serve as reliable benchmarks for evaluating more advanced machine learning or deep learning approaches.  

## üìÇ Dataset  
- **Source**: Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM)  
- **Frequency**: Daily exchange rate data  
- **Training Period**: 2014 ‚Äì 2022  
- **Testing Period**: 2023  
- **Currencies**: MYR/USD, MYR/EUR, MYR/GBP  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Collected daily exchange rates from BNM.  
   - Handled missing values using interpolation for weekends and public holidays.  
   - Transformed data into a standardized time series format.  

2. **Stationarity Check**  
   - Applied Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to confirm stationarity.  
   - Differencing was applied when necessary.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - **ARIMA**: Traditional time series model fitted using auto.arima in R.  
   - **DARIMA**: Data split into smaller yearly subseries, fitted with ARIMA individually, then combined into a global model.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  

5. **Forecasting**  
   - Conducted one-step-ahead forecasts for 2023.  
   - Generated 95% confidence intervals.  

## üìä Key Findings  
- **DARIMA outperformed ARIMA**, achieving lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE across MYR/USD, MYR/EUR, and MYR/GBP.  
- Both models produced reliable forecasts, with actual 2023 values falling within their confidence intervals.  
- External factors such as geopolitical conflicts and monetary policies strongly influence MYR movements, highlighting the limits of purely statistical models.
